In Fig.\ref{fig:ProClamping}, from 6 to 9 and from 16 to 20, the subway is in the {\em Rush Hours}. During rush hours, the probability for doors clamping is 0.4. The normal hours are from 5 to 6, from 9 to 16, and from 20 to 22, the probability is 0.25.

In Fig.\ref{fig:ProbabilityOverTimeFigure}, for one duration, we suppose that the highest probability of doors clamping for the train doors is 0.5 (the black one in Fig.\ref{fig:ProbabilityOverTimeFigure}), and, as the screen doors are closed after train doors, the probability of doors clamping for screen doors is smaller (e.g., 0.25) than the probability for train doors.
During doors closing, the probability  of doors clamping will decrease with time.
